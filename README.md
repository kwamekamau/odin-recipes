# odin-recipes

A super-simple recipe website, to demonstrate the use of foundational HTML
(and eventually CSS) as presented in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). It uses basic tools and skills such as:

 - proper HTML page structure
 - hyperlinks
 - lists
 - images

The homepage contains a list of recipes with links to each recipe on its own page.

The recipes, including the images, are excerpted from *Healthy Living Made Easy*, a cookbook from [Thrive Market](https://www.thrivemarket.com).
