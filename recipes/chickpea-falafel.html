        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            These lightened-up chickpea patties get started on the stovetop and
            finished in the oven, giving them the crunchy outer layer usually
            achieved with deep-frying, only with less mess. They're wonderfully
            addictive on their own or as the main component of a pita sandwich,
            with parsley, cucumbers, cabbage, and yogurt sauce.
